          Cementitious waterproofing is one of the most commonly used systems for internal wet areas in the UAE, such as water tanks, bathrooms, kitchens, and basements. It's made by mixing dry cement-based powders with water or a liquid acrylic additive to create a slurry that's brushed onto surfaces. Once cured, it forms a rigid waterproof layer that bonds well with concrete.

          One of the main advantages of cementitious systems is ease of application. They require minimal surface preparation and can be applied using basic tools. That’s why they’re often chosen for residential and light commercial projects. However, they do have drawbacks. Because the coating hardens and has limited flexibility, it's vulnerable to cracking when exposed to thermal expansion, vibration, or building movement — all common in the UAE’s extreme climate.

          At RainSafe, we typically use cementitious coatings as a base layer in confined wet areas, then reinforce them with more flexible top coatings. For roofs, terraces, and outdoor surfaces exposed to heat and UV rays, we recommend switching to more modern liquid membranes that adapt better to temperature fluctuations. If your current system shows signs of peeling, hairline cracks, or moisture seepage, it may be time to upgrade.
